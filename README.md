This Retail Analytics Case Study addresses stagnant growth and declining customer engagement. The objectives are to use data (Sales, Customer, Inventory) to analyze product performance, segment customers (Low, Mid, High Value) by purchase quantity, and study customer behavior/loyalty to improve inventory, marketing, and retention strategies.
